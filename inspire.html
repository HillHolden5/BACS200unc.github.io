        <h2>Why is my dad my hero?</h2>
	    <p>My dad is my hero because of who he is as a person.</p>
	    <p>My dad is one of the hardest workers I know. He had to work very hard in his life to achieve what he wanted. He is always there for me when I need him, and he is someone who I want to live my life like.</p>
	    <p>My dad introduced me to sports, which I fell in love with. Because of this, I have found something that I want to do in my life. My dad went to the University of Iowa, and one of my life goals would be to win</p>
	    <p>a National Championship with the University of Iowa Football team. My dad also taught me how to be disciplined and frugal with money. When I got my first job in high school, my dad helped me set up a savings account.</p>
	    <p>Because of this whatever job I have had I have always put part of my paycheck into savings. Recently my dad and I set up a Roth IRA as well.</p>
	    <p>My dad has truly been someone who I can look up to and someone who inspires me every day.</p>

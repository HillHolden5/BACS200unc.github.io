    <h1>Videos I Find Funny</h1>
  <h2> Minute Silence Interrupted at Chelsea VS Werxham</h2>
  <a href="https://youtu.be/xQYyuemZOCc?si=aepLfXLngljHgt_h">Minute of Silence Interrupted at Chelsea VS Wrexham</a>
      <p> I think that this video is really funny, because of how passionate soccer fans get in Europe. This video is from a little while ago, and it's this Wrexham fan who is at home, and they are playing Chelsea. 
        They are having a moment of silence, and one of the fans of Chelsea, says something during it, and the whole stadium erupts with noise.</p>
<h3> Let's Stick with Last Names - Kim's Convience</h3>
  <a href="https://youtu.be/0RBzE6R6ZgQ?si=Rm0SSVVR_muS4wEU">Let's Stick with Last Names - Kim's Convience</a>
    <p> This video is funny because of the context of the show. This is one of my favorite shows, Kim's Convenience. It's about a Korean family who has a convenience store in Toronto Canada. Mr.Kim is talking to his friend, Mr. Metta. 
    They have been friends as long as Mr.Kim and his family have been in Toronto. What is funny about it is they don't actually know their first names. They always call each other Mr. Kim and Mr.Metta.</p>
<h4> Family Guy - Quagmire's new big, green grill</h4>
  <a href="https://youtu.be/6cMwEiFJMpE?si=4JZnNin34mmeh008">Quagmire's new big, green grill</a>
    <p> Family Guy is one of my favorite shows, this is one of my favorite scenes. In the scene, Quagmire is showing Peter the new grill he got. He wants to use the grill how it is supposed to be used, with slow-cooking food. 
    But Peter wants to use it to fire up some burgers or other meats. Then Quagmire shows Peter all of his other new toys, and the disagreements continue with Peter wanting to be aggressive with the new toys, but Quaagmie
    wants to use them as they are supposed to be used. </p>
